# Simultaneous true/false discovery bound for invariance causal prediction

This repository contains R code for calculating the simultaneous true/false discovery bound as presented in the paper ["On the error control of invariant causal prediction"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03834).
 It also includes all the code necessary to reproduce the numerical results from the paper.

The functions in the ‘Functions/InvariantCausalPrediction’ folder are primarily copied from the R package ‘InvariantCausalPrediction’ (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/InvariantCausalPrediction/index.html), with one modified function, ‘ICPnew.R,’ which outputs all sets and their corresponding p-values from testing invariance.
